- 👋 Hi, I’m Cooook
- 👀 I’m interested in Binary Security(Fuzzing & Program Analysis) and now working at accelerating cross-architecture emulation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning virtualization(DBT and hardware-assitant), embedded firmware, that's super interesting.
- 🎣 Well, I started fishing this year and I'm learning bass fishing. I want to be a good angler.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me about both fishing and research. zyfan020305 [AT] gmail.com
